## Welcome to Melodia

Unfortunately, Spotify has changed the rules for accepting applications, so this application will no longer be published for everyone to use. Therefore, the purpose of this repository will be:

1. To make the code free so that it can be used and viewed by anyone.
2. If you want to see your information, do the following:

- Clone the project
- Go to the Spotify Dashboard and create your project
- Change the .env file to your keys
- Add the "<http://localhost:3000/callback>" route in the Redirect URIs field
- Add your email in the User Management tab
- Change the redirect route in login.ts to "<http://localhost:3000/callback>"
- Run the project with "npm run dev"

Discover your most listened to artists and songs!

Thanks for checking out the project!
